# The Scrum Checklist

This checklist is based on the Scrum guide mainly, but there are some extra items that come from some other sources. It checks that the roles, events, artifacts and rules are correct and working as they should.
The list is hosted in a public repository because receiving new items or changes in the items that already exist are very welcome.


## The list:

#### Scrum theory

- [ ] Understand Scrum is an incremental and iterative process.
- [ ] The process must be visible and transparent to scrum users so everybody shares a common understanding.
- [ ] Scrum users inspect scrum artifacts to detect undesirable variances.
- [ ] The process or the materials should be adapted asap before the outcomes are unacceptable.

#### Scrum values
- Scrum team members are aligned with these values:
	- [ ] Commitment, to achieve team goals.
	- [ ] Courage, to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
	- [ ] Focus, on the sprint goals.
	- [ ] Openness, about the challenges with performing the work.  
	- [ ] Respect each other as capable and independent people.

#### Scrum team


None of the items listed here are based on my experience or intuition, I wanted to create this list because I was not applying scrum as it should and I was using "my" common sense. If that is your case too, I recommend you this article: [We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatbaseball/)
