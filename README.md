# The Scrum Checklist

scrum: Is an agile framework for managing complex adaptative problems using incremental interations.

This checklist is based on the Scrum guide, it checks that the roles, events, artifacts and rules are correct and working as they should. As long as we humans tend to forget how things work and even worse, use our intuition to figure out problems, I decided to write down in a list key points of scrum framework. The list is hosted in a public [github repository](https://github.com/jmir17/scrumChecklist) because receiving contributions are very welcome.


## The list:

#### Scrum theory
- [ ] Everybody understands that Scrum is an incremental and iterative process.
- [ ] The process must be visible and transparent to scrum users so everybody shares a common understanding.
- [ ] Scrum users inspect scrum artifacts to detect undesirable variances.
- [ ] The process or the materials are adapted before the outcomes are unacceptable.


#### Scrum values
Scrum team members are aligned with these values:
- [ ] Commitment, to achieve team goals.
- [ ] Courage, to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- [ ] Focus, on the sprint goals.
- [ ] Openness, about the challenges with performing the work.  
- [ ] Respect each other as capable and independent people.


#### Scrum team
- [ ] Scrum team is self-organized, to choose how best to accomplish their work.
- [ ] Scrum team is cross-functional, to have all competencies needed to accomplish the work.

    ##### Product Owner
    - [ ] Maximizes the value of the product with the development team work.
    - [ ] Product owner decisions are visible.
    - [ ] Product owner decisions are respected by the entire organization.
    - [ ] Only product owner manages the product backlog, and:
        - [ ] Clearly expresses product backlog items.
        - [ ] Ensures a product backlog visible, transparent and clear for all.
        - [ ] Ensures development team understands product backlog items.
        - [ ] Orders product backlog items to best achieve business goals.
        - [ ] Optimizes value of development team work.
        - [ ] Shows scrum team what will work on next.

    ##### Development Team
    - [ ] Work incrementally and iteratively.
    - [ ] The team is structured and empowered to self-organize their own work.
    - [ ] No one tells (even scrum master) how to release functionality.
    - [ ] No one but the product owner tells which requirements to implement.
    - [ ] The team is cross-functional able to deliver any product increment.
    - [ ] There are no titles for development team members, regardless of what they do.
    - [ ] There are no sub-teams, eg: testing, architecture, design,...
    - [ ] Recognition belongs to the team as a whole.
    - [ ] The team size is between 3 and 9 members.

    ##### Scrum Master
    - [ ] Promotes and supports the scrum process.

        Hels product owner to:

        - [ ] Find techniques to maintain product backlog effectively.
        - [ ] Create clear and concise product backlog items.

    - [ ] The work planned for the first day(s) is decomposed at the end of the meeting.

    ##### Scrum daily

None of the items listed here are based on my experience or intuition, I wanted to create this list because I was not applying scrum as it should and I was using "my" common sense. If that is your case too, I recommend you this article: [We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatbaseball/)
