None of the items listed here are based on my experience or intuition, I wanted to create this list because I was not applying scrum as it should and I was using "my" common sense. If that is your case too, I recommend you this article: [We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatbaseball/)
